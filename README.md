# 🦢 **Johan de Witt Swan Widget**  
*A desktop companion that squishes, quacks, and judges your life choices.*

## **Features:**  
✅ **Squish Factor™** – Click him, and he compresses like a virtual stress-relief rubber duck. Double click and he quacks.  
✅ **Speech Bubble System** – He has **historically accurate sass**, and he *remembers* if you click too much.  
✅ **Dragging Complaints** – Move him around, and he will **vocally object** to being kidnapped.  
✅ **Idle Animations & Speech** – He subtly floats and **comments on your workflow—or lack thereof.**  
✅ **Stroopwafel Feeding** – Drag and drop his favorite snack (limited daily for *historical realism*).   
✅ **Right-Click Menu** – Functional actions like feeding, resigning (*closing*), and capturing the screen.

### **📢 Feedback & Bug Reports**  
**Please report any bugs if you find them!** If Johan glitches out, gets stuck, or refuses to be properly squishable, let me know.  
**Any feedback is welcome!** If you have ideas for **new features, quotes, or interactions**, I’d love to hear them.
